#  Smart Contract Management

This project showcases a basic implementation of a cryptocurrency management system using Solidity, designed to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. Users can deposit, withdraw, and check balances through a simple web interface.
## Description


The "Smart Contract Management" project showcases a simple implementation of a cryptocurrency management system using Solidity, tailored for interaction with the Ethereum blockchain. It consists of a Solidity smart contract defining essential functions for managing balances, an HTML interface for user interaction, and JavaScript code utilizing Web3.js for blockchain communication.
## Getting started
## Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at-https://remix.ethereum.org/



## Smart Contract (contract.sol):
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Cryptocurrency {
    mapping(address => uint256) private balances;

    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);

    function incrementBalance(uint256 value) public {
        balances[msg.sender] += value;
        emit Transfer(address(0), msg.sender, value);
    }

    function decrementBalance(uint256 value) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= value, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= value;
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, address(0), value);
    }

    function getBalance(address account) public view returns (uint256) {
        return balances[account];
    }
}

## Run
Accessing the Repository:

Navigate to the GitHub repository where your project is hosted.
Setting Up Remix:

Visit the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.
Opening Remix:

Launch Remix in your web browser.
Creating a New File:

In Remix, click on the "+" button in the file explorer panel.
Name the new file contract.sol.
Copying Solidity Code:

Copy the Solidity code from your project's contract.sol file on GitHub.
Pasting Solidity Code:

Paste the copied Solidity code into the editor in Remix.
Compiling the Contract:

Switch to the "Solidity Compiler" tab in Remix.
Click on "Compile Contract" to compile your Solidity code.
Deploying the Contract:

Move to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in Remix.
Ensure your contract is selected under "Deployed Contracts".
Choose an environment (e.g., JavaScript VM for testing, Injected Web3 for production).
Click "Deploy" to deploy your contract. Confirm the transaction if using MetaMask or similar.
Interacting with the Contract:

Once deployed, interact with the contract using the provided interface in Remix.
Test functions, view state variables, and simulate transactions as needed.
Saving Work:

Save your work periodically in Remix to preserve changes and configurations.
